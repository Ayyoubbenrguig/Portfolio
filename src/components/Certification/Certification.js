              In this 10 courses Professional Certificate, I developed and honed hands-on 
              skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. I started with
              an orientation of Data Science and its Methodology, became familiar
              and used a variety of data science tools, learned Python and SQL,
              performed Data Visualization and Analysis, and created Machine
              Learning models. In the process I completed several labs and
              assignments on the cloud including a Capstone Project at the end to
              apply and demonstrate my knowledge and skills.
